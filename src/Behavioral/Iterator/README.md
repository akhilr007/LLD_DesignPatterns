## Iterator Design pattern

- the iterator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. this pattern is particularly useful when you need to traverse a collection of objects in a standard way.

- Major elements in `iterator design pattern`
  - `Iterator` - interface mainly has next() and hasNext()
  - Concrete Iterator - implementation of next and hasNext plus
  - Product class or main class
