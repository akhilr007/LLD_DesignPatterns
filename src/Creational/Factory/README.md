### Factory

Here's a breakdown of when to use each of these factory-related design patterns:

- Simple Factory:
  - Use Case:
    - Use the Simple Factory pattern when you have a set of related classes and want to create instances of these classes based on a given input or parameter.
  - Example:
    - Suppose you have different types of shapes (Circle, Square, Triangle), and based on user input, you need to create instances of these shapes. You can use a Simple Factory to centralize the creation logic.


- Factory Method:
  - Use Case:
    - Use the Factory Method pattern when you have a base class/interface with multiple subclasses and want each subclass to decide which class to instantiate.
  - Example:
    - In a document editor application, you have a `Document` interface with subclasses like `TextDocument`, `SpreadsheetDocument`, and `PresentationDocument`. Each subclass can have its own `factory method (createDocument)` to instantiate specific document types.


- Abstract Factory:
  - Use Case:
    - Use the Abstract Factory pattern when you need to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
  - Example:
    - In a GUI toolkit, you might have different themes (e.g., LightTheme, DarkTheme) and components (Button, Checkbox) for each theme. An abstract factory can define methods (createButton, createCheckbox) to create theme-specific UI components. Each concrete factory (LightThemeFactory, DarkThemeFactory) provides implementations for these methods.


- Summary:
  - `Simple Factory`  is straightforward and useful when the creation logic is centralized and doesn't vary much.
  - `Factory Method` is suitable when subclasses need to control the creation of objects and you want to defer instantiation to subclasses.
  - `Abstract Factory` is ideal when you need to create families of related objects without specifying concrete classes, such as creating theme-specific sets of objects in a GUI application.
